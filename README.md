# acleaderboard
-----
A Web leaderboard plugin for *Assetto Corsa Dedicated Server*, running on POSIX-compatible systems. (Note that the plugin doesn't have to run on the same machine that *Assetto Corsa Dedicated Server* is running on.)

### Compile
---
```
$ cmake .
$ make
```
### Run
---
No configuration needed. just `./acleaderboard`. Then the plugin will automatically listen on `localhost:12000`. The current version is still hardcoding this configuration for my own convenience.

### License
---
GPLv3.

### Demo
---
Still in development.

### Contributor
---
Nicholas Wang for sure, and all folks in the WeChat group helping the test & debug.

### Still not working?
---
I may not constantly focusing the issue tab but I would try my best. However I recommend contact me on Telegram: [@nicholascw](https://t.me/nicholascw).
